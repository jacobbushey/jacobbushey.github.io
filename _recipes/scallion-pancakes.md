## Description
Makes 2 large pancakes.

These scallion pancakes should be up to one centimeter thick, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside with plenty of flaky layers.


## Ingredients
* 400 grams of flour
* 280 grams of cold water
* One bunch of scallions (or more)
* 8 grams salt
* Vegetable oil (eyeball the quantity)

## Preparation

1. Add water to flour and knead with your hands. The dough should be really soft and will stick to your hands. Do not succumb to the temptation to add flour! Keeping the dough soft is very important for the texture. Once the dough has mostly formed, you can wash your hands and dust them with flour before going for the final knead

2. Separate the dough into two balls and roll in just a little bit of flour. Cover with a damp cloth and let dough rest for 20 minutes.

3. Chop the green onions. To achieve small pieces, cut the stalks lengthwise into quarters before chopping across.

4. Once the dough has finished resting, dust your countertop with flour and gently roll one dough ball at a time into a circular round. Periodically lift up the dough (or roll it around your rolling pin) and reflour so that the dough doesn’t stick to your surface. You want the dough to achieve a thickness of about 0.1-0.2 cm.

5. Scatter half the salt (a generous 4 grams) evenly across the dough, and then use the rolling pin to lightly press it into the dough.

6. Drizzle some oil in the middle of the dough and fold the sides in one at a time to evenly coat the entire circle. If the oil doesn’t totally coat the surface, add some more.

7. Scatter the scallions evenly across the dough.

8. Gently roll the dough into a coil, making sure not to squeeze the scallions out. Once the whole
thing is rolled, pinch the ends shut, twist it little by little with both hands (starting from the
middle), and coil it into two stacked circles (see video)

9. Let rest for 20 minutes covered in a damp cloth.

10. Roll the dough out into a 1cm thick round. Heat a pan to medium heat, and put the pancake in.

11. Once the pancake is lightly browned on one side, flip it over and cover so that it can steam.

12. After several minutes, when the other side is also lightly brown (but before it’s complete cooked
inside), take off the cover, pick up the pancake up with a spatula, and throw it back to the pan
two times so that the layers can separate.

13. Add oil to the pan and swirl the pancake around in it. Once one side has browned, flip it over.

14. Take the pancake out of the pan, let it cool, and cut!
