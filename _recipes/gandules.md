## Ingredients

- 1.5 pounds of the gandules â€” 2 cans
- Onion
- Pepper (any color)
- kabocha squash
- 2 cans coconut milk

## Preparation:

1. Wash the gandules in water and pick out any floating peas

1. Add a little oil to a pot and put in the peas. Stir them in the oil. Add hot water to the pot with peas. Cover and get to a boil/ simmer.

2. Boil additional water separately. Cut up half a kobocha squash into small quarter inch slices. Keep a few bigger pieces

3. After simmering for 20 minutes add bigger kabocha pieces

4. Add smaller pieces of kabocha when soft to the peas. 

5. Add in cilantro and onion and pepper to the gandules after 40 min. All in big chunks
