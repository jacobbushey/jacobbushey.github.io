A delicious cake for any day or holiday, made with sweet potatoes, cinnamon and ginger. Topped with Honey Cinnamon Buttercream for a perfect combination.


## Ingredients
### Cake

* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons baking soda
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
* 1 tablespoon ground ginger
* 16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
* 2 cups granulated sugar
* 3 large eggs, lightly beaten
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 2 1/2 cups mashed cooked sweet potatoes, cooled (about 4-5 sweet potatoes)
* 1 cup whole buttermilk

### Frosting
* 8 ounces (224g) full-fat block cream cheese, softened to room temperature
* 1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
* 3 cups (360g) confectioners’ sugar, plus an extra 1/4 cup (30g) if needed
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 1/8 teaspoon salt

## Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 350-degrees F. Butter and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. Line bottoms with baking parchment and butter the top of those too.

1. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and ginger. Set aside.

1. In the bowl of a mixer, beat together butter and sugar on medium-high for 4-5 minutes until creamy, stopping to scrape down bowl at least twice. Gradually add beaten eggs. Beat on medium-high for 1-2 minutes until fluffy, scraping down bowl as needed. Add vanilla and sweet potatoes and beat until smooth, scraping down bowl as needed (scraping down the bowl is important stuff, y’all).

1. Add the dry ingredients into the butter mixture in thirds, alternating with buttermilk. Beat on low speed until just incorporated, scraping down bowl as needed.

1. Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake at 350-degrees F for 35-45 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Allow to cool in pans for 10 minutes, then invert onto cooling rack to cool completely.

### Frosting

1. In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on high speed until smooth and creamy. Add 3 cups confectioners’ sugar, the vanilla, and salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. If you want the frosting a little thicker, add the extra 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar (I add it).

1. Cover and store leftover frosting for up to 5 days in the refrigerator or up to 3 months in the freezer. After freezing, thaw in the refrigerator then beat the frosting for a few seconds so it’s creamy again.

### Notes
* Quantity: This recipe is enough to frost 12-18 cupcakes or one 9×13 quarter sheet cake. 1.5x the recipe for a double layer cake or add extra cream cheese, confectioners’ sugar, and a splash of milk or cream as shown in my carrot cake and red velvet cake recipes. (Doubling the recipe would be far too much.)
