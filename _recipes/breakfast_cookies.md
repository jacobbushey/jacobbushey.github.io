## Details
Breakfast cookies! A tasty and substantial breakfast, especially with yogurt.

Makes 10 large cookies.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup quick cooking oats (or old-fashioned, which is what I use)
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
* 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1 1/2 cups peeled grated carrots (or sweet potatoes)
* 1 cup roughly chopped nuts (I use cashews)
* 1/4 cup raisins (preferably golden)
* 1/2 cup honey or maple syrup (or less)
* 1/2 cup melted coconut oil


## Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 375-degrees F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a large bowl, combine oats, flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and ginger. Whisk to blend. Add the carrots, raisins, and nuts and stir to combine.

3. In a medium bowl, combine the honey and coconut oil. Whisk until blended. Pour the liquid mixture into the flour mixture and stir until just combined. The dough will be rather wet.

4. Drop 1/4 cup scoops of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Gently flatten each cookie to about 3/4 inch thick.

5. Bake until the cookies are golden and firm around the edges, 15 to 17 minutes. Cool the cookies on the baking sheet on a cooling rack for 10 minutes, then carefully transfer cookies to the rack to cool completely (to prevent bottoms from browning too much). Leftover cookies can be kept covered at room temperature for up to 2 days, in the fridge for up to 5 days, and in the freezer for up to 3 months.
