## Details
This is a favorite dessert of Lucas's dad. It's very creamy, tasty, and rich.

TIME: 90 Minutes
## Ingredients
### Flan
* 1 can sweetened condensed milk
* 2 cans evaporated carnation milk
* 6 egg yolks
* 2 tablespoons corn starch
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* Optional: a few tablespoons of raisins

### Caramel
* 4 tablespoons sugar
* 2 tablespoons water (or more)

## Preparation
### Caramel
1. Mix sugar and water. Boil water until it turns light brown. Try to use the same pan that will be used to bake the flan.

### Flan
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

1. Mix  1 can of evaporated milk and the six egg yolks. 

1. In a separate bowl mix 1 can sweeten condensed milk, 1 can evaporated milk, corn starch, vanilla, and cinnamon.

1. Beat both vigorously and combine.

1. Place ingredients in the caramel pan.

1. Submerge the flan pan in another pot with water. Water should come up to the 2/3 mark on the flan pan.

1. Bake for 60 minutes. Add cold water if the water starts to boil. Don't allow water to boil or it will become flambe!
