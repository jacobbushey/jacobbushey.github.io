## Details

YIELD: 12 Small Scones

TIME: 30 Minutes

You may be accustomed to the gigantic, sweet scones in coffee shops in this country. They are nothing like the diminutive, light scones that originated in Britain and Ireland. This is a whole-wheat version, only moderately sweet -- the way I think scones should be. You can always top them with jam or honey if you want more sugar. The whole-wheat flour brings a rich, nutty flavor to the scones. 

## Ingredients
#### FOR THE SCONES:

* 150 grams (approximately 1 1/4 cups) whole-wheat flour
* 62 grams (approximately 1/2 scant cup) unbleached all-purpose flour
* 40 grams (approximately 1/3 cup) oatmeal
* 10 grams (2 teaspoons) baking powder
* 5 grams (1/2 teaspoon) baking soda
* 25 grams (approximately 2 tablespoons) raw brown sugar (turbinado)
* 3 grams (approximately scant 1/2 teaspoon) salt
* 70 grams (2 1/2 ounces / 5 tablespoons) unsalted butter
* 125 grams (approximately 1/2 cup) buttermilk
* 75 grams (approximately 1/2 cup) raisins

## Preparation
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment.

1. Sift together flours, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt. Stir in oatmeal. Rub in butter, or place in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle and beat at low speed, or pulse in a food processor, until incorporated. 1. Add buttermilk and raisins and mix just until dough comes together.

1. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and gently shape into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle. Cut either into 2-inch circles with a biscuit cutter or into 6 squares, then cut each square in half on the diagonal. Transfer to baking sheet. Bake 15 minutes, until browned on the bottom. Flip over, bake 2 more minutes, and remove from the heat. Serve warm or allow to cool.

### Tips
* Advance preparation: These will keep for couple of days at room temperature and freeze well.
