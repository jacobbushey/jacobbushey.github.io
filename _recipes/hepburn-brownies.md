## Description

YIELD: 12 Brownies

TIME: 45 Minutes

Much like its author, this recipe is a no-fuss classic. It calls for just 1/4 cup of flour, which yields an incredibly rich and gooey brownie, and it's super easy to make. 
## Ingredients
#### FOR THE SCONES:

* ½ cup cocoa
* ½ cup butter (1 stick)
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup sugar
* ¼ cup flour
* 1 cup chopped or broken-up walnuts or pecans
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
*  Pinch of salt

## Preparation

1. Heat oven to 325 degrees.
Melt butter in saucepan with cocoa and stir until smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes, then transfer to a large bowl. Whisk in eggs, one at a time. Stir in vanilla.

1. In a separate bowl, combine sugar, flour, nuts and salt. Add to the cocoa-butter mixture. Stir until just combined.

1. Pour into a greased 8 x 8-inch-square pan. Bake 30 to 35 minutes. Do not overbake; the brownies should be gooey. Let cool, then cut into bars.
