## Description

YIELD: 8 Scones

TIME: 65 Minutes

## Ingredients

* All-purpose flour - 2 ¾ cups of all purpose flour is needed to make these wonderfully tall and thick scones.
* Granulated sugar - ⅓ cup is all I use and find it adds a light sweetness to the dough.
* Baking powder & baking soda - Using both leavening agents helps achieve the perfect texture and rise from the scones.
* Salt & Vanilla - Enhances flavor.
* Orange zest - Adds the orange flavor in every bite.
* Unsalted butter - It's essential to use cold butter and cut into small pieces.
* Cranberries - Fresh cranberries are best for this recipe.
* Fresh orange juice - Chill the orange juice before using.
* Whole milk - I don't recommend substituting the milk. It must be cold as well.
* Heavy cream - You can also use milk. This is brushed over the top of the scones just before baking to provide a golden color.
* Coarse sugar - Sprinkled on top to create a little crunch.

## Preparation

1. In a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and orange zest together.

1. Cut the butter into the flour mixture using a pastry blender, 2 knives, or your fingertips. The mixture should look like coarse crumbs. Gently fold in the cranberries.

1. Whisk the orange juice, milk, and vanilla together then gradually add it to the flour mixture. Stir just until the dough comes together. You may not need all the orange juice mixture. Add a little at a time until the dough is moist but not too wet. Do not over mix the dough or the scones will be tough.

1. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and gently knead four or five times. Pat the dough into a 7-inch round circle.

1. Cut the circle in half, then cut each half into four triangle-shaped wedges. Arrange the scones 2 inches apart on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place the scones in the freezer for 30 minutes.

1. Meanwhile, position the oven rack to the center of the oven and heat to 400°F.
Brush the tops of the scones with heavy cream and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool and drizzle with glaze.

#### Make the Glaze
1. Combine all the ingredients for the glaze in a small bowl and whisk until smooth.

### Tips
* Cranberries: I like fresh cranberries best because they're dry and don't stain the dough. You can use packaged, frozen, and thawed cranberries but keep in mind they may be wet and stain the dough. If you have fresh cranberries that have been frozen, these will work beautifully. Dried cranberries will also work.

* Keep the dough cold: The scones need to be cold when going into the oven. Placing the shaped dough into the freezer for 30 minutes ensures the scones will bake up light and fluffy. Alternatively, you can place the scone dough in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
