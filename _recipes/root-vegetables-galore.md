## Description
This dish was born out of a fridge clean-out, and is a great way to use up whatever root vegetables you have. Whatever your combination, just keep the total net weight the same. Serve this as a veggie main, along with a simple salad.

* Prep 8-10 min
* Cook 60 min

## Ingredients
* ½ celeriac (400g), peeled and cut into 6 wedges (350g)
* 2 baking potatoes, skin-on, each cut into 8 wedges (500g)
* ½ small kabocha or crown prince pumpkin, skin-on, seeds removed and cut into 6 wedges (500g)
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 75ml olive oil
* 500ml chicken (or vegetable) stock
* 1 x 400g tin chickpeas, drained (240g)
* 1½ tbsp rose harissa
* 1 lemon
* 10g dill leaves, roughly chopped
* 3 tbsp dukkah, shop-bought or homemade

For the tahini yoghurt
* 75g tahini
* 115g Greek-style yoghurt
* 2½ tbsp lemon juice
* 2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
* Salt and black pepper

1. Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Add the root vegetables, tomato paste, two tablespoons of oil, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper to a large roasting tin roughly 38cm x 26cm, and toss everything together to combine. Pour in the stock, then bake for 30 minutes.

1. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl toss together the chickpeas, harissa, two tablespoons of oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt and set aside.

1. When ready, spoon the chickpea mixture all over the vegetables and turn up the oven to 240C (220C fan)/450F/gas 9. Return to the oven and bake for another 20 minutes, or until everything is nicely coloured and the vegetables are well cooked. Set aside to cool slightly, for about 10-15 minutes.

1. Meanwhile, segment the whole lemon and roughly chop the segments. Transfer this and any juices collected (but not the pips) to a bowl along with the dill and remaining tablespoon of oil.

1. In a separate bowl, whisk together all the ingredients for the tahini yoghurt with 55ml of water and a quarter-teaspoon of salt until smooth and pourable.

1. Spoon a good amount of the tahini-yoghurt over the vegetables followed by all of the dill mixture. Lastly, sprinkle over the dukkah and serve the remaining tahini yoghurt alongside.
