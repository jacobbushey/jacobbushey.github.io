## Description
Servings: 4

Sesame Noodles, or Ma Jiang Mian (麻醬麵): a humble yet elegant Taiwanese classic. Simple and flavorful — quite the perfect meatless weeknight meal.

## Ingredients
* 800 grams fresh wheat noodles
* 4 tablespoons Chinese/Taiwanese sesame paste (Zhi Ma Jiang)
* 4 tablespoons light soy sauce
* 4 tablespoons dark soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon Chinese black vinegar (or rice vinegar)
* 2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
* 4 teaspoons sugar
* 2 teaspoon chili oil (optional)
* 2 teaspoon mushroom bouillon (optional)
* 0.68 cup (80 g) hot water (from cooking noodles)
* 2 pinch salt, to taste

#### Toppings
* 2 scallion, finely chopped
* 60 grams roasted peanuts, crushed

## Preparation

1. Prepare Sesame Sauce. In a bowl, combine sesame paste, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, black vinegar, toasted sesame oil, sugar, mushroom bouillon (optional), and chili oil (optional).

1. Prepare Noodles. Cook noodles according to package instructions. Drain noodles and reserve the hot (starchy) cooking water.

1. To Finish. Add a desired amount of the hot cooking water to the sesame sauce. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt. To assemble, place noodles in a bowl, ladle in the sauce, and garnish with scallions & crushed peanuts. Mix while still hot and enjoy.

### Notes
* Sesame Paste. Chinese/Taiwanese Sesame paste (Zhi Ma Jiang) gives the distinct flavor of the dish. Its flavor profile is very different from tahini: tahini is made from unroasted & hulled sesame seeds, while Chinese/Taiwanese sesame paste is made from roasted & unhulled sesame seeds. Substitutes: 1) one-to-one ratio of tahini & peanut butter. 2) replace all with peanut butter.
* Note that this dish, as well as the version in Din Tai Fung, is usually made from chicken stock/soup. In most cases, vegan options are available upon request. For this vegan version, you can add mushroom bouillon to achieve the same umami flavor. Alternatively, use a brand of chili oil that packs some umami (note that my homemade chili oil gets its umami from MSG).
