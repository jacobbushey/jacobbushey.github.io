Savoury muffins packed with four different vegetables. Light and fluffy making them perfect for baby-led weaning, toddlers and the lunch box. 


## Ingredients
* 1 medium (250g) Zucchini, grated
* 1 medium (120g) Carrot, grated
* 1/4 cup (30g) Frozen Peas
* 1/4 cup (30g) Frozen Corn
* 1 cup (125g) Cheddar Cheese, grated
* 1/2 cup Milk
* 1/4 cup Plain Greek Yoghurt
* 1/4 cup Olive Oil
* 2 Eggs
* 2 cups (250g) Plain Wholemeal Flour *See Note 1
* 3 tsp Baking Powder

## Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 180C / 350F

1. Place the zucchini and carrot onto a clean dish towel and wrap it around the vegetables.  (see image above) Squeeze all the juice out. *SEE NOTE 2

1. Place the zucchini and carrots into a large mixing bowl along with the peas and sweetcorn. Add the cheese, milk, yogurt, olive oil and egg and stir until combined.

1. Mix the flour and baking powder together and then slowly add to the wet ingredients. Fold in gently, until just combined.  *SEE NOTE 3

1. Spray a 12 hole muffin tray with oil or grease with butter. Spoon the mixture, equally, between the 12 muffin sections.  Bake for 20-25 mins. *SEE NOTE 4

### Notes

1. I used a plain wholemeal flour, I am currently living in Australia and find their wholemeal flour whiter in colour and it appears more processed than the wholemeal flour I was used to in the UK. I can not guarantee what the results will be like with less processed wholemeal flour as I haven't tested although some people have commented that it produced a denser muffin. The recipe will also work well with plain / all purpose flour.
1. Don't throw away the juice. Save it and add it to smoothies or pasta sauces etc.
1. Don't be tempted to over stir the mixture. The mixture should be lumpy, thick and looking very messy. It should only take around 10 strokes with your wooden spoon.
1. Every oven is different, so while you should still follow the bake time in this recipe, use a skewer to test your muffins a couple minutes before the end of the bake time. Your skewer will come out clean if they are ready.
1. Please note: I have not added extra salt to this recipe as a lot of my readers are parents who do baby-led weaning. I used a strong cheddar and felt it gave enough flavour. However, reader feedback indicates that they lack in flavour and salt is needed.  Adding chopped herbs is also an option.
