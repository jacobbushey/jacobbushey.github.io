## Ingredients
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 large yellow onion, diced.
* 1 pepper (any color), diced. 
* 4-6 cloves garlic crushed (or minced)
* .5 bottle pitless goya manzanilla olives with pimientos. Ideally cut up.
* 2-3 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1.5 cup rice
* 1-2 packets goya sazon w/ coriander and annatto (orange box)
* 6 chicken thighs, or equivalent breast/drumstick
* 1.5 teaspoons oregano
* 1.5 teaspoons cumin
* 4 cups cut up veggies -- can use any of the following: potatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes, yukka, plaintains
* salt and pepper to taste
* optional: cilantro for garnish

## Preparation:

1. Heat up olive oil in a large pot. Add diced pepper, onion, oregano, and cumin. Stir occasionally.

2. When the onions have softened add garlic. Let cook for ~1 minute, then add olives. Don't be afraid to put the olive liquid in too -- it adds flavor!

3. Add tomato paste, sazon, and 1.5 cups water. 

4. Stir it up and add Chicken. Let chicken simmer for 10 minutes.

5. Add rice and a lot of cold water into the pot, enough that you will be able to fit the carrots and potatoes in.

6. Wait until the water starts boiling, then add vegetables. Let simmer until rice is cooked and veggies are soft. Add salt, bouillion, or sazon if more flavor is needed.

#### Variation
- You can also make this recipe with shrimp and scallops instead of chicken. The only difference is that you put the scallops and shrimp in with the veggies. Their cook time is significantly shorter.
