#### FOR SERVING (_**optional**_)

*   Fresh lemon or lime juice

### Instructions

1.   Heat a large rimmed skillet or pot over medium heat. Once hot, add water (or oil) and shallot. Sauté for 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until softened and slightly browned.
   
1.   Add garlic, ginger, and serrano pepper and sauté for another 2-3 minutes. Then add carrots and a pinch of salt and stir. Cook for 1-2 minutes more, stirring occasionally. 
   
1.   Add vegetable broth and coconut milk and increase heat to medium high. Bring to a low boil. Then add lentils and stir. Once the mixture comes back to a low bubble, reduce heat to low or until you achieve a gentle simmer.
   
1.   Add coconut aminos and curry powder and stir once more. Simmer the soup uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 12-16 minutes or until the carrots and lentils are tender (red lentils cook pretty quickly, so if you're using other lentils, adjust cook time as needed). If the mixture becomes too thick, you can add more coconut milk or vegetable broth as 1.eeded. (We added a bit more of each to thin.)
   
1.   Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt or coconut aminos for saltiness / depth of flavor or more curry powder for intense curry flavor.
   
1.   Divide between serving bowls and garnish with fresh cilantro and lemon juice or a little fresh coconut milk or cream (optional). Store cooled leftovers in the refrigerator up to 5 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat on the stovetop until hot, adding more vegetable broth to thin as needed. 
    
### Notes

\*Nutrition information is a rough estimate calculated without optional ingredients.  
\*Curry powder is not a common ingredient used in traditional Indian cooking, but rather an invention of the British to evoke the flavors of Indian cuisine. The term "curry" in Indian cooking refers to a sauce or gravy served with vegetables or meat. ([source](https://www.thespruceeats.com/curry-powder-and-indian-food-1957468))
