  <div class="bio">I am a PhD Student in the Wofsy Group at 
Harvard. I am originally from Virginia Beach, via Charlottesville 
(Go Hoos!). I enjoy running, biking and hiking. My research focuses 
on developing novel methods to constrain anthropogenic methane

MethaneAIR and MethaneSAT projects.</div>  </div>
