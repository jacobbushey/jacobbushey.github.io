I hope that, as this website develops, friends, family and strangers who are curious about what I do will stumble upon this page. If that's you, welcome!

The best place to start with understanding what I do is to start with the basics of climate change. If climate change is a phrase that typically makes you roll your eyes, I'm especially happy you've found this post.

It's my goal to always be open to challenging questions and critiques about the nature of my research. In order to have conversations like that, it's important that we share a common knowledge base and language for discussing these topics. Thankfully, some of the brightest minds in the discipline, over at MIT, have made this "Climate Primer" website. It's a great place to get started. I hope you enjoy it.
